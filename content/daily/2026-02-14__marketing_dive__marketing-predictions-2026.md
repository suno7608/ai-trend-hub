summary_ko: "Marketing Dive의 2026 마케팅 예측에 따르면, AI가 마케팅 성과의 양극화를 초래할 것으로 예상된다. AI를 효과적으로 활용하는 기업과 그렇지 못하는 기업 사이의 격차가 급격히 벌어질 것이며, 특히 퍼소널라이제이션, 콘텐츠 생성, 고객 세분화 분야에서 경쟁 우위가 결정될 것이다. 또한 규제 강화와 프라이버시 규정이 데이터 기반 마케팅의 방식을 근본적으로 바꿀 것으로 예상된다."
summary_en: "Marketing Dive forecasts that 2026 will be characterized by AI-driven polarity in marketing performance. The gap between AI-effective companies and laggards will widen dramatically, with competitive advantage determined in personalization, content generation, and customer segmentation. Regulatory tightening and privacy requirements will fundamentally reshape how data-driven marketing operates."
so_what_ko: "D2C 마케팅팀들은 AI 기반 개인화 플랫폼(예: Klaviyo, Segment)에 대한 투자를 가속화해야 한다. 동시에 제로파티 데이터(고객이 자발적으로 제공한 데이터) 수집 전략을 개발하여 규제 환경 변화에 대비해야 한다."
so_what_en: "D2C marketing teams must accelerate investment in AI-driven personalization platforms (e.g., Klaviyo, Segment) to maintain competitive parity. Simultaneously, develop zero-party data collection strategies to prepare for evolving regulatory requirements and build customer trust through transparent data practices."
key_points:
  - "AI will create winners and losers in marketing; laggards in AI adoption face competitive extinction"
  - "Zero-party data collection and privacy-first personalization will become essential competitive advantages"
  - "Content generation via AI will become commoditized, shifting competition to personalization and context relevance"

## Overview

Marketing Dive convened a panel of industry experts to forecast major marketing trends for 2026. The consensus view: artificial intelligence will be the primary driver of market dynamics, but not uniformly. Instead, AI adoption will create a bifurcated market where winners pull further ahead and laggards fall further behind.

## The 9 Predictions

1. **Personalization Becomes Non-Negotiable**: Brands not delivering AI-powered personalization will struggle to compete. Consumers now expect individualized experiences as table-stakes.

2. **Zero-Party Data Surges**: As third-party cookies disappear and privacy regulations tighten, brands that master zero-party data collection (customers willingly sharing preferences) will thrive.

3. **Content Generation Goes Commodity**: AI-generated content becomes ubiquitous and undifferentiated. Brands must move beyond raw generation to curation, editing, and contextual relevance.

4. **Agile Marketing Teams Scale Down**: Smaller, more specialized teams using AI leverage will outperform larger traditional marketing departments.

5. **Email Personalization Deepens**: Email marketing, augmented by AI, becomes the primary direct-relationship channel for customer engagement.

6. **Regulatory Burden Increases**: Privacy regulations (GDPR extensions, regional privacy laws) will force marketing operations to retool for compliance.

7. **Customer Acquisition Costs Rise**: As competition for attention intensifies and platforms increase ad prices, CAC will continue climbing.

8. **Brand-Customer Direct Relationships Strengthen**: Brands investing in owned channels will reduce platform dependency and improve profitability.

9. **Attribution Becomes Harder**: The disappearance of deterministic tracking will make multi-touch attribution more complex and less reliable.

## D2C Relevance

For direct-to-consumer brands, these predictions reinforce a critical strategic priority: invest in zero-party data collection and AI-driven personalization within owned channels. The brands that succeed in 2026 will be those that can deliver highly individualized experiences while complying with privacy regulations and reducing platform dependency.
