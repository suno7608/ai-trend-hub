summary_ko: "eMarketer의 최신 분석에 따르면, AI 쇼핑 도구는 소비자 수용이 증가하고 있지만 소매업체의 저항이 시장 성장을 제한할 수 있다는 우려가 제기되고 있다. 데이터 소유권, 마진 압박, 고객 관계 통제 상실에 대한 우려가 많은 전통 소매업체들의 채택을 지연시키고 있다. 2026년의 시장 성장률은 초기 예측보다 낮을 수 있으며, 기술과 규제 문제가 주요 병목 현상이 될 것으로 예상된다."
summary_en: "eMarketer's latest analysis reveals that while AI shopping tools are gaining consumer traction, retailer pushback threatens to slow market growth. Concerns about data ownership, margin compression, and loss of customer relationship control are delaying adoption among traditional retailers. 2026 market growth may fall short of earlier predictions, with technology integration and regulatory challenges emerging as key bottlenecks."
so_what_ko: "D2C 브랜드들은 대형 소매업체의 저항을 기회로 보고, 자체 에이전트 기술을 먼저 도입하는 경쟁 우위를 확보할 수 있다. 소비자들이 AI 쇼핑 경험을 갈망하고 있지만 전통 소매업체가 뒤처지는 만큼, 혁신적인 D2C 플레이어들이 시장 점유율을 빼앗을 수 있는 황금 기회다."
so_what_en: "D2C brands should view retailer hesitancy as an opportunity to gain first-mover advantage in proprietary agentic technology. With consumers craving AI-powered shopping experiences while traditional retailers lag, innovative D2C players can capture market share and customer loyalty during this transition window."
key_points:
  - "Consumer demand for AI shopping tools is strong, but retailer resistance to data loss and margin compression is slowing adoption"
  - "First-mover D2C brands can establish customer preference for their agentic experiences before large retailers catch up"
  - "Regulatory clarity on data privacy and AI transparency may emerge as a competitive differentiator"

## Overview

eMarketer's research team conducted interviews with 200+ retail executives across North America and Europe to assess current agentic commerce adoption and sentiment. The findings reveal a significant gap between consumer readiness and retail willingness to adopt AI shopping agents.

## Consumer Adoption vs. Retailer Hesitation

On the consumer side, the data is unambiguous: 67% of surveyed online shoppers say they would be "very likely" or "likely" to use an AI shopping agent to discover products, and 54% would trust an agent to make recommendations in their category of interest.

However, retail executives express caution. Only 38% of traditional retailers surveyed have concrete plans to deploy agentic commerce tools in 2026, compared to 72% of pure-play e-commerce companies and digital natives.

## Key Concerns Driving Hesitation

1. **Data Sovereignty**: Retailers fear that deploying agents through third-party platforms surrenders first-party data to tech giants.

2. **Margin Pressure**: If AI agents commoditize product comparison and accelerate race-to-bottom pricing, retailer margins could compress further.

3. **Brand Control**: Retailers worry that agent-mediated shopping experiences will dilute their brand positioning and customer relationship.

4. **Implementation Complexity**: Many retailers lack the technical infrastructure and talent to implement agentic systems in-house.

## Implications for D2C

For direct-to-consumer brands, this reluctance among traditional retailers creates a window of opportunity. D2C companies that invest in proprietary agentic experiences now can establish customer preference and loyalty before larger competitors catch up. Additionally, D2C brands can differentiate by offering greater transparency about how their AI agents work and what data they collect—building trust that platform-mediated alternatives may struggle to achieve.
