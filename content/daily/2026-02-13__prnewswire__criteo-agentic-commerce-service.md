## Overview

Criteo, a leading performance marketing and recommendation technology company, announces its entry into the agentic commerce space with a dedicated recommendation service. Rather than building full agentic platforms, Criteo is taking a focused approach: provide the best-in-class recommendation capability that other developers can integrate into their own agents.

## The Service Details

Criteo's Agentic Commerce Recommendation Service offers:

1. **Personalized Product Recommendations**: Powered by Criteo's proprietary machine learning models trained on commerce behavior data across billions of transactions.

2. **Developer-Friendly API**: Easy integration for developers building AI agents, chat applications, or shopping assistants.

3. **Real-Time Performance**: Recommendations are generated in real time with sub-100ms latency, enabling natural conversational shopping experiences.

4. **Flexible Integration**: Works across multiple agent platforms, AI assistants, and chat frameworks.

## Strategic Implications

Criteo's launch signals an important shift in how agentic commerce will be built. Rather than monolithic platforms controlling the entire agent experience, a modular approach is emerging where:

- **Recommendation engines** come from specialized providers like Criteo
- **Natural language understanding** comes from LLM providers like OpenAI or Anthropic
- **Inventory and order management** come from commerce platforms like commercetools or Shopify
- **Customer data platforms** provide unified customer profiles

This modular approach offers distinct advantages:

1. **Best-in-class components**: Each part of the agent is optimized for its specific function.
2. **Reduced platform lock-in**: Brands can swap components if a competitor offers better functionality.
3. **Faster innovation**: Specialized companies can innovate in their domains independently.

## For D2C Brands

This is particularly good news for D2C brands that want proprietary agentic experiences. Rather than relying on Google, Amazon, or Microsoft's agents, D2C companies can now assemble a competitive agent using best-in-class components, keeping customer data and relationships proprietary.

The downside: D2C brands must have the technical capability to integrate multiple APIs and build a cohesive customer experience. This is more work than using a pre-built platform, but offers significantly greater control.
