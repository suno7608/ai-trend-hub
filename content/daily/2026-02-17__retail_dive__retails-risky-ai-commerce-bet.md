summary_en: "Major retailers including Google, Etsy, and Wayfair are facing significant risks of losing data control as they invest heavily in agentic AI commerce. As large tech platforms mediate the shopping experience, retailers risk ceding control of customer data and direct relationships. This shift threatens retailer margins and long-term competitive positioning in an AI-driven commerce landscape."
so_what_ko: "D2C 브랜드들은 자체 AI 쇼핑 경험을 구축하거나 소유한 채널 전략을 강화해야 한다. 플랫폼에 의존하기보다는 고객 데이터와 관계를 직접 관리할 수 있는 독립적인 에이전트 AI 기술에 투자하는 것이 장기 생존 전략이다."
so_what_en: "D2C brands must prioritize building proprietary AI shopping experiences or strengthen owned-channel strategies. Rather than relying on platform intermediaries, investing in independent agentic AI technologies that maintain direct customer data control and relationships is essential for long-term competitive survival."

  - "Retailers risk losing customer data ownership and direct relationships to tech platforms mediating agentic commerce"
  - "Data dependency on third-party platforms could reduce margins and limit competitive differentiation"

## Overview

Retail Dive reports on the growing tensions between retailers and technology platforms over agentic commerce implementations. As Google, Etsy, and Wayfair increasingly integrate with large language models and AI shopping assistants, traditional retail players face a critical decision point about data sovereignty.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals that retailers adopting agentic commerce through third-party platforms are essentially ceding control of customer interactions and data insights. When AI agents handle customer queries, recommendations, and transactions, the platform—not the retailer—captures valuable first-party data about consumer preferences, purchase intent, and browsing behavior.

This dynamic mirrors earlier concerns about platform dependency that emerged during the social media era, but with even higher stakes in commerce. Unlike social platforms where engagement metrics matter, commerce platforms hold actual transaction data and customer lifetime value insights.

## Impact on D2C

For direct-to-consumer brands, this represents both a threat and an opportunity. The threat is clear: if major D2C players delegate customer interactions to platform agents, they lose the very data assets that should give them competitive advantage. The opportunity lies in taking the opposite path—building proprietary agent experiences that keep customers within owned ecosystems.

## Strategic Implications

Successful D2C retailers will likely adopt a hybrid approach: participate in platform ecosystems where necessary for reach, but maintain proprietary AI agents for first-party customer relationships and data collection.
