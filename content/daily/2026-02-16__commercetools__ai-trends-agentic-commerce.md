## Overview

commercetools, a leading composable commerce platform, outlines the transformation underway in agentic commerce. The report synthesizes market observations and platform capabilities to identify the seven trends most likely to define commerce technology in 2026.

## The 7 Trends

1. **Multimodal Agent Interactions**: AI shopping agents now seamlessly handle text queries, image searches, voice commands, and video content—enabling customers to shop the way that feels natural to them.

2. **Real-time Inventory Orchestration**: Agentic systems are driving demand for live inventory visibility across channels, enabling agents to provide accurate fulfillment promises in real time.

3. **Composable Architecture Maturity**: The shift toward microservices-based commerce architectures accelerates, enabling rapid innovation and agent integration without monolithic platform constraints.

4. **Agent Personalization at Scale**: AI agents learn individual customer preferences, creating truly personalized shopping funnels rather than segmented experiences.

5. **Autonomous Order Management**: Agents now handle complex order scenarios (splits, substitutions, cancellations) without human intervention, improving customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

6. **Cross-channel Agent Coherence**: Customers interact with consistent agent personas across web, mobile, chat, voice, and in-store channels.

7. **Ethical AI and Transparency**: Regulatory compliance and consumer trust drive adoption of explainable AI agents that disclose their limitations and data usage practices.

## Relevance to D2C

For D2C brands, the shift toward composable architectures is particularly important. Rather than being locked into a single platform's agentic capabilities, composable approaches enable brands to mix and match the best-in-class components: a superior AI inference engine from one vendor, inventory management from another, and order orchestration from a third.

This modularity creates competitive advantage for brands that can integrate these components effectively.
